## Abstract
The solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation constitutes the state-of-the art in order to compute excitonic properties in solids.  The screening of the electron-hole interaction is commonly computed by restricting to the electronic contribution, while effects  of lattice screening are usually either completely neglected or evaluated using simplifying models for the dielectric function. In this work, we present an approach accounting for the effects of lattice screening from first principles by including the phonon contribution to the screened Coulomb interaction into the solution of the BSE. Our approach explicitly accounts for the dynamics of the lattice screening, which is crucial in order to capture the different time scales of exciton formation and lattice vibrations. Being valid for all types of materials, we apply the developed approach to the case of polar insulators and semiconductors where strong Fr\"ohlich coupling is present. We compute excitonic binding energies in various semiconductors including MgO and GaN and find good agreement with the Wannier-Mott model and experimental values.
